trimis de:	gmail.com



Te salut Bogdan!

Scuze ca a durat mai mult sa-ti trimitem testul, a trebuit sa-mi iau ceva timp liber si nu am planuit chestia asta..

 

Atasez cele 2 teste pentru tine (cel de .net si cel de react).  Avem rugamintea ca dupa ce le rezolvi, sa adaugi si cateva unit tests facute cu ajutorul copilot 😉

Cu cat ai putea sa le rezolvi mai repede, cu atat mai bine pentru noi.

Multumim si mult success!
